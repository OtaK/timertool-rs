# timerset-rs

TimerSet is an utility to check and modify the Windows Timer Resolution.

## PSA: Please be aware that raising your Timer Resolution on a laptop has huge effects on battery life and is generally a bad idea!

## Usage

The program should be run from an elevated (ie. cmd => run as administrator) terminal prompt.

Obviously, it only works on Windows. Confirmed to work on Windows 10 2004, but should run on pretty much any version of Windows since the used APIs are so old.

    -u, --uninstall    Uninstalls TimerSet from your system
    -v, --values       Prints the possible timer value range for your system. Please note that it can depend on many
                       factors such as HPET or dynamic/synthetic timers enabled or disabled

                           lowered down according to unknown factors (windows ancient magic????)
